    <h1>Organic Farming :: Organic Inputs and Techniques</h1>
    <pre>
Manures are plant and animal wastes that are used as 
sources of plant nutrients. They release nutrients after their 
decomposition. The art of collecting and using wastes from animal, human
and vegetable sources for improving crop productivity is as old as agriculture. 
Manures are the organic materials derived from animal, human and plant residues 
which contain plant nutrients in complex organic forms. Naturally occurring or synthetic 
chemicals containing plant nutrients are called fertilizers. Manures with low nutrient, content
per unit quantity have longer residual effect besides improving soil physical properties compared 
to fertilizer with high nutrient content. Major sources of manures are:
1. Cattle shed wastes-dung, urine and slurry from biogas plants
2. Human habitation wastes-night soil, human urine, town refuse, sewage, sludge and sullage
3. Poultry Jitter, droppings of sheep and goat
4. Slaughterhouse wastes-bone meal, meat meal, blood meal, horn and hoof meal, Fish wastes
5. Byproducts of agro industries-oil cakes, bagasse and press mud, fruit and vegetable processing wastes etc
6. Crop wastes-sugarcane trash, stubbles and other related material
7. Water hyacinth, weeds and tank silt, and
8. Green manure crops and green leaf manuring material
        Manures can also be grouped, into bulky organic manures and concentrated organic manures based on concentration of the nutrients.</pre>
        <h3>Bulky organic manures</h3>
        <p>Bulky organic manures contain small percentage of nutrients and they are applied in large quantities. Farmyard manure (FYM), compost and green-manure are the most important and widely used bulky organic manures. Use of bulky organic manures has several advantages:

            They supply plant nutrients including micronutrients
            They improve soil physical properties like structure, water holding capacity etc.,
            They increase the availability of nutrients
            Carbon dioxide released during decomposition acts as a CO2 fertilizer and
            Plant parasitic nematodes and fungi are controlled to some extent by altering the balance of microorganisms in the soil.</p>
        <h3>Sheep and Goat Manure</h3>
        <p>The droppings of sheep and goats contain higher nutrients than farmyard manure and compost. On an average, the manure contains 3 per cent N, 1 per cent P2O5 and 2 per cent K2O.It is applied to the field in two ways. The sweeping of sheep or goat sheds are placed in pits for decomposition and it is applied later to the field. The nutrients present in the urine are wasted in this method. The second method is sheep penning, wherein sheep and goats are kept overnight in the field and urine and fecal matter added to the soil is incorporated to a shallow depth by working blade harrow or cultivator or cultivator.</p>
        <h3>Poultry Manure</h3>
        <p>The excreta of birds ferment very quickly. If left exposed, 50 percent of its nitrogen is lost within 30 days. Poultry manure contains higher nitrogen and phosphorus compared to other bulky organic manures. The average nutrient content is 3.03 per cent N; 2.63 per cent P2O5 and 1.4 per cent K2O.</p>
